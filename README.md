Planning:
1. have a world with certain destinations, blockages, roads, rivers, monsters, etc
2.	Have a set 5 characters or NPS, all with certain skills and deficiencies (like dungeons and dragons) that will affect their ability to navigate through the game 
3.	All of the characters have to arrive at a certain destination in the quickest way possible. Have a formula for each obstacle which takes in skill and difficulty etc to determine how long it would take to get past each obstacle,
4. [BONUS]	Maybe extra level of difficulty is 2 characters cannot be at the same location at the same time, so if a character has to go through a path they will also have to determine if itâ€™ll take longer to wait or if it will be better to just go a different path
