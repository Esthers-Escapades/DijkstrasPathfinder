Given: al of map, start_node, end_node, list of characters
Output: distance from Start Node to End Node
//test case
start node == end Node
start node 

main method
    create new List locations, with points A - J, basically saying these are the neighbords of all of the locations

    create a new List with location_info, will take in String, int[x,y,terrain_type,monster_encounter]> this graph will determine the 
    A : {3,3,0,1} 

   

    pass graph1 graph2 and start node in method 1
    pass hashmap from method 1 into method 2 

method 0: determine distance 

method 1: dijkstra's algorithm
    get al, 
    part 1: output hashmap of all of the distances
    part 2: output hashmap of all distances based on specific character


method 2: print out length of time from Start node to end node using hashmap from method 1
    time = get A.key[B]
    return "The amount of time it takes to get from point A to B is: " + time + " minutes"
